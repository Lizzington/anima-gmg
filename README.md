# GMG Anima Repository

### Testing Spaces
Please make sure to use a branch under your name for testing.
It will be labeled "testing-" and your first name initial for your testing branch.

### Level Creation
If you are working on a main level, go under *Scenes*, and there are scenes labeled "Level1", "Level2", or "Level3"
There are empty scenes in these levels, so feel free to make your levels there!

>***Important note:*** To avoid any future errors putting levels together, please communicate with each other on who is making which level and/or which puzzles in the level. Github will give merging errors if more than one person is messing with the same game objects within the same scene/level.

### Merging Levels into One Game
*We will do this later towards Demo Day when we finish all of our levels.*

Once we finish all of our levels, you can start to create a "pull request". This means you can put your branch into the "main" branch, where we will put all of the levels together to create our game! Since I'm the owner, I'll need to approve your levels before I can merge them into the main game.
